            There is an input field in the box below. It has a value "Alladin".
            Do you know what was supposed to be filled in that input field?

              type="text"

        <h1>Labels or Instructions</h1>

        <p>
          If you were to clear the filled value in the input field you just saw,
          you'll find that the instruction about what to fill in the input does
          exist. Unfortunately, the developer decided to put it as the
          placeholder of the input.{" "}
          <mark>
            Placeholders vanish as soon as any text is entered in the input
            field
          </mark>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          What's wrong in it? Nowadays many input fields in the{" "}
          <mark>
            forms are auto-filled by browsers for us. In such a situation, if
            the user wants to cross-check the filled values if they are
            appropriate, they have no way to know what's really asked in a
            particular input field!
          </mark>{" "}
          The same issue also applies to a user with short memory who started
          filling the form and then wants to verify the fields mid-way. So
          always label your input fields such that the label/instruction is
          accessible to the user at all times.

          Present instructions or labels that identify the controls in a form so
          that users know what input data is expected.
